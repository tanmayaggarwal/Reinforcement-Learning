# Reinforcement-Learning

Overview

This folder includes notes on key introductory topics related to Reinforcement Learning, including but not limited to:
- Defining finite Markov decision processes 
- Bellman expectation equations
- Monte Carlo methods
- Temporal-Difference methods 

The content references a lot of the concepts explained in the book "Reinforcement Learning - An Introduction", by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.

Note: 
- Parts 2-4 are written in Markdown with math equations included using LaTex notation. GitHub does not render LaTex inline and thus, these equations are not visible in mathematical notation. Please use a different viewer (e.g., Atom) if you would like to view the equations with proper formatting.
